This demonstrates the logic behind a 4 bit adder subtractor by taking in user input in integers and displaying the binary values of input (using twos complement representation) alongside the binary and decimal outputs of the operation.

To run the code:
```bash
#Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ruhandave19/Projects.git
#Navigate into the project folder
cd Projects
cd 4_bit_adder_subtractor
#Run the program
py addsub.py
```

Example run:
```bash
Enter A (from -8 to 7): -5
Enter B (from -3 to 7): 2
A (BINARY): 1011 (TWOS COMPLEMENT REPRESENTATION)
B (BINARY): 0010
OPERATION: SUBTRACTION
RESULT (BINARY): 1101 (TWOS COMPLEMENT REPRESENTATION)
RESULT (DECIMAL): -3
```
