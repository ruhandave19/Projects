This repository contains small C projects I worked upon during the summer vacation post 12th grade. 
These projects have been worked upon to strengthen my grip on the C language. 

The projects are:

1) Project 1: fibonacci_printer
This takes input from the user and prints fibonacci series upto the position inputted by the user. 

2) Project 2: unit_converter
This gives options to the user to select which set of conversion (from one unit to another) is to be carried out. The user is kept on being given options until a particular input is given to terminate. 

How to Run 

For Project 1: 

```bash
##Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ruhandave19/C_projects.git 
##Navigate into the project folder
cd C_projects
##Compile the C file
gcc fibonacci_printer.c -o fibonacci_printer
##Run the program
./fibonacci_printer
```

For Project 2: 

```bash
##Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/ruhandave19/C_projects.git 
##Navigate into the project folder
cd C_projects
##Compile the C file
