The projects in this repository are:

(1) Project 1: fibonacci_printer (C)
This takes input from the user and prints fibonacci series upto the position inputted by the user. 

(2) Project 2: unit_converter (C)
This gives options to the user to select which set of conversion (from one unit to another) is to be carried out. 
The user is kept on being given options until a particular input is given to terminate.

(3) Project 3: password_security_toolkit (Python)
Consists of 3 projects:
(a) Password Strength Analyzer: This takes a password input from the user and returns a score (WEAK/MODERATE/STRONG/VERY STRONG)
(b) Password Generator: This generates a password of length 30 with atleast one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one character and one digit.
(c) Demo: This allows the user to make a custom password (ie, with custom length, type of characters to be used) with the generator which then uses the analyzer to give a rating to the generated password.
